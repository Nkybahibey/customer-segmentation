# customer-segmentation
Implementing a customer segmentation analysis using K-means clustering algorithm. I imported the libraries needed, got my dataset from Kaggle, used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for segmentation, finally, visualised the clusters, providing insights into customer behaviours.
